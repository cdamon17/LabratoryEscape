The setting of my game is a laboratory for an unknown group that the main character seems to know called “The Organization”.

Some puzzles that I created/experimented with were door puzzles, where the player either had to find passwords to unlock doors or find a creative way to open doors that the player can not unlock with  password.

I have a total of 6 rooms and 17 objects ranging from doors to items you interact with in order to get out.

I had much trouble trying to design doors with pass code locks, and in all honesty I needed much help from Mrs. Kiang and Mr. Kiang after unsuccessful attempts in order to create and debug them, but I feel I was able to better understand how the coding of inform works and to look at other source code for help on similar problems.

While I did ask a lot of help from Mr. Kiang and Mrs. Kiang, and felt that they were actually the most help to creating my game, I did find helpful advice and ideas with in the “Documentations” part of inform and looking at source code from other games.
